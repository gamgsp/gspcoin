 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Gspcoin Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.

 This package provides the daemon, gspcoind, and the CLI tool
 gspcoin-cli to interact with the daemon.

Description: peer-to-peer digital currency - standalone transaction tool
 Gspcoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant, private
 payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Gspcoin uses peer-to-peer
 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Gspcoin Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.
 .
 This package provides gspcoin-tx, a command-line transaction creation
 tool which can be used without a gspcoin daemon.  Some means of
 exchanging minimal transaction data with peers is still required.
