Gspcoin Core v2.5
===========================
Cryptocurrency that links to modern Digital Advertising and Marketing.

What is Gspcoin?
GSP Coin is a project that aims to build a new ecosystem for digital and mobile advertising, allowing advertisers to create and manage campaigns through our platforms like Global Ads Media | Global Social Post | Global Smtp Mail  with complete automation. A revolutionary Real Time Bidding system allows advertisers to gain most of required web traffic and track the result of their investments in a completely automated fashion. The GSP Coin token will serve as the platformâ€™s internal currency and will be used within the ecosystem.
Gspcoin is a decentralized financial technology accessible to everyone that is fast, reliable and secure with negligible transaction costs. 
Gspcoin has its own blockchain, which is a fork of Raptoreum codebase with ASIC resistant POW algorithm and consensus ensuring Smartnodes which make the network immune to 51% attacks. Gspcoin coins can be mined on both CPU and GPU. Gspcoin cares about privacy and has an integrated CoinJoin mechanism that allows to hide the balance directly in the wallet.

Problems Gspcoin attempts to solve

Gspcoin is a transparent and scalable financial system that aims to make cryptocurrencies
accessible to everyone. There are four main directions in which we want to contribute.

1. Make managing GSPC easy for everyone by deploying mobile wallets for the major
mobile OS, such as Android and IOS.

2. Promote the adoption of cryptocurrencies by offering a payment gateway service. The
service will provide a free plugin for small businesses to facilitate online transactions in
cryptocurrency. Customers will be able to pay for goods and services in GSPC, while an
entrepreneur will receive fiat money to his/her credit card.

3. We think that all cryptocurrencies deserve to have access to the investors and to be
tradable at an exchange. To achieve this goal we want to remove entry barriers in the form
of high exchange listing fees and to offer everyone Bitroeum Exchange with its own
blockchain, where all coins interested in listing can be traded against Bitroeum.

4. We believe that everyone should be able to get a part of the financial pie with high returns
that is usually accessible only to rich investors. That is why everyone can earn coins with
modest initial investment by deploying Smartnodes and contributing to the blockchain
stability and security.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is meant to be stable. Development is done in separate branches.
[Tags](https://github.com/gspcoin/gspcoin/tags) are created to indicate new official,
stable release versions of Gspcoin Core.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](src/test/README.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`. Further details on running
and extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).

There are also [regression and integration tests](/test), written
in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/test) are installed) with: `test/functional/test_runner.py`

The Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and OS X, and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.
